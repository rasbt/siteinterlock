***A novel approach to pose selection in protein-ligand docking based on graph theory.***

`siteinterlock` is a Python package for selecting near-native protein-ligand docking poses based upon the hypothesis that interfacial rigidification of both the protein and ligand prove to be important characteristics of the native binding mode and are sensitive to the spatial coupling of interactions and bond-rotational degrees of freedom in the interface.

The `siteinterlock` toolkit was developed in the [Protein Structure Analysis & Design Laboratory](http://www.kuhnlab.bmb.msu.edu) at Michigan State University. For additional information on the theory behind the SiteInterlock project, please refer to the accompanying research publication:
